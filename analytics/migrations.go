// Package analytics holds the ANALYTICAL database's schema (ADR 0006): the
// golang-migrate files under migrations/, embedded so cmd/exceptions-projector
// applies them without a migrations directory in the image (the same approach
// as the OLTP migrations in the top-level migrations package). The analytical
// database is separate from the OLTP one; it is written only by
// cmd/exceptions-projector and read (read-only) by cmd/exceptions-reports.

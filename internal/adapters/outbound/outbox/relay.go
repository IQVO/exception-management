// Package outbox is the transactional-outbox relay: a background loop that
// drains the outbox table (written in the same transaction as the aggregate,
// see postgres.OutboxPublisher/OutboxStore) one row at a time through a
// Handler — in production the Kafka adapter's RelaySink, which encodes each
// fact to its CloudEvents of ADR 0004 and writes it to the broker, parking
// rows it can never publish on the dead-letter topic.
//
// The shape is the fleet's relay (pick-face-replenishment / slotting-
// optimization, after inventory-storage's outbox_relay.go): drain every
// interval (default 1s), a full batch is followed immediately by another
// pass, a failed pass is logged and retried after the interval, and delivery
// is at-least-once with the CloudEvents id persisted at enqueue time so a
// retry republishes the same id.

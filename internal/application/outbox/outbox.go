// Package outbox holds the neutral types of the transactional outbox's relay
// side: what a persisted outbox row looks like once decoded (Row/Fact) and
// what a Kafka-bound message looks like (Message). The types live here — not
// in ports (interfaces only) and not in an adapter — so the Postgres store,
// the Kafka encoder/sink and the relay itself share them without any adapter
// importing another adapter (only cmd/ wires adapters together).
//
// Delivery is at-least-once: a row is only removed after its message was
// accepted by the broker, and the CloudEvents id is minted ONCE at enqueue
// (OutboxPublisher) and persisted with the row, so a relay retry republishes
// the same id and consumers dedupe on it.

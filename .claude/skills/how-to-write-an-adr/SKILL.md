description: Write an Architecture Decision Record for exception-management in this repo's numbering and format, including companion ADRs for cross-repo changes. Use when a design decision should be recorded or a change contradicts an existing ADR.

# How to write an ADR

Use when a change is architecturally significant: a new bounded-context
integration, a reversal of a prior decision, a cross-repo contract change, a
new policy kind, or anything a future reader would otherwise reverse-engineer
from the diff. A bug fix or a routine feature inside an already-decided
architecture does not need one.

## Numbering and location

`docs/adr/NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`, four digits, sequential. List the folder
first (`git ls-tree --name-only origin/develop -- docs/adr/`) and take the next
integer; never reuse or guess. Today the set is `0001` (bounded context),
`0002` (aggregates, invariants, auto-resolve policy), `0003` (local copies
and consumed contracts) and `0004` (CloudEvents envelope and type catalogue).

For a cross-repo reference, list the sibling's `docs/adr/` (or its docs
folder) on its `origin/develop` before citing a number; do not cite from
memory.

## Format

The ADR files carry no frontmatter. Copy the shape of
`docs/adr/0002-aggregates-and-policy.md`:

```markdown
# ADR NNNN: a short statement of the decision

## Status

Accepted (YYYY-MM-DD).

## Context

The forces at play, in the past tense, as if explaining to someone who was not
there. State the alternatives seriously considered, not only the one chosen.

## Decision

What is decided, as an active present-tense declaration ("we will...").
Specific enough to implement from scratch without follow-up questions: name the
package, type, topic, env var or table.

## Consequences

What becomes easier, what becomes harder, what is deferred. Be honest about
the downsides.
```

The `## Decision` section deserves the most editing. Model it on
`docs/adr/0001-exception-management-bounded-context.md` (canvas, context map
with the relationship per edge, explicit exclusions — no manual case creation,
ops-agent read-only — planned edges marked as planned) and
`docs/adr/0003-local-copies-and-consumed-contracts.md` (consumed contracts
verified against each producer's develop branch, consumer env names and
modes).

## Keeping the guides and gates in step

- A new CloudEvents type: add it to `apis/asyncapi.yaml` AND to the type
  catalogue in `docs/adr/0004-cloudevents-envelope-and-type-catalogue.md`
  (`TestEventCatalogueMatchesContract` fails otherwise), then update
  `.claude/rules/integration-events.md`.
- A new aggregate or invariant: update `.claude/rules/domain-model.md` in the
  same PR, and add any new `internal/domain/` package to the mutation gate.
- A new route: `apis/openapi.yaml` and `.claude/rules/rest-api.md`.
- Run `python3 scripts/harness/guide_lint.py` (or `make guide-lint`): it fails
  on a guide that cites a missing file.

## Superseding an earlier ADR

Do not edit the old ADR's Decision. Change the old ADR's `## Status` to
`Superseded by ADR NNNN` (a one-line patch) and open the new ADR with
`Accepted (date). Supersedes ADR MMMM.`

## Cross-repo decisions: a companion ADR, not one repo's private opinion

When a decision spans two repos, write ONE ADR per repo, each pointing at the
other as "the companion ADR" with a one-line split of responsibility. The
consumed-contract rows in ADR 0003 are the example: each producer records its
half in its own repo, because each bounded context's docs are read
independently.

## Verify

Check every link and number you cite. Nothing in CI here catches a broken ADR
link; verify them by hand.

# How to add a REST endpoint

Use when asked to add a new REST use case or endpoint to this service. Follow
this order, domain first and adapter last, never the reverse: writing the HTTP
handler before the domain invariant it enforces produces handlers that
validate nothing and use cases that get bypassed.

Layer status: the domain (`internal/domain/exceptioncase`,
`internal/domain/exceptionpolicy`, `internal/domain/shared`) and the contract
(`apis/openapi.yaml`) are committed. The application layer, the HTTP adapter
and `cmd/` are built in a later step, so steps 2 and 3 below describe the
shape to follow and name no file yet. Once they exist, read an existing
endpoint of the same kind alongside this guide.

Worked example, `PUT /exception-policies/{sourceType}` (`DeclareExceptionPolicy`):
the invariants are in `internal/domain/exceptionpolicy/policy.go` (`Declare`,
`Redeclare`, `Restore`) and `internal/domain/exceptionpolicy/rule.go`
(`NewRule` — the declarative auto-resolve rule is DATA, never executable
code), the contract is the `/exception-policies/{sourceType}` entry of
`apis/openapi.yaml`, and the route-to-use-case table is
`.claude/rules/rest-api.md`.

## 1. Domain first: does an invariant already exist, or do you need one?

Check `internal/domain/exceptioncase`, `internal/domain/exceptionpolicy` and
`internal/domain/shared` for the rule this endpoint enforces. An endpoint
should almost never contain business logic: it decodes a request, calls a use
case, encodes the result. If the operation needs a new rule (for example a new
validation on `exceptioncase.Case`, or a new field on
`exceptionpolicy.Policy`), add it to the aggregate or value object with its
own table-driven test BEFORE touching the application or adapter layers.
Return a sentinel error (`exceptioncase.ErrCaseClosed` style, in
`internal/domain/exceptioncase/errors.go`) so the adapter can map it with
`errors.Is`. Write decisions as `if` chains with early returns (the mutation
gate counts every `case` as a mutant), and add the package to the mutation
gate if it is a new one under `internal/domain/`.

Remember the exclusion of ADR 0001: there is deliberately no
`POST /exceptions` — every case is opened by a consumed fact, never by an
operator; REST only triages, assigns and resolves.

## 2. Application: define the use case

In the application layer (one package, one file per use case), define the use
case as a struct that depends on driven ports only, never a concrete adapter,
with an `Execute` method:

```go
type TriageException struct {
    Cases  ports.CaseRepository     // interface only
    Outbox ports.Outbox             // events leave via the transactional outbox
    Clock  ports.Clock              // never call time.Now() directly
}

func (uc *TriageException) Execute(ctx context.Context, in TriageInput) error {
    // 1. load the case through the port
    // 2. call the aggregate method (c.Triage); never inline the invariant
    // 3. persist and write the outbox row in ONE transaction
    // 4. return domain types, not DTOs
}
```

Ports are interfaces ONLY (fitness tests in `internal/architecture/` enforce
it). Unit-test the use case against an in-memory implementation of the ports,
never a real Postgres or HTTP call, and cover the success path AND each
domain-rule failure path (`ErrCaseClosed` on a resolved case, blank actor,
zero timestamp). Rules that span aggregates, such as exactly one open case per
dedup key (`shared.DedupKey`), live in the use case and a partial unique
index. The use case reads the event-fed local copies and never calls a
sibling context.

## 3. Adapter: wire the HTTP handler

In the inbound HTTP adapter (an `inbound/http` package under the adapters, a
later step):

1. DTO structs (camelCase JSON tags) live ONLY in the adapter; domain types
   never carry JSON tags.
2. The handler: decode with unknown fields rejected (the contract sets
   `additionalProperties: false`), convert to domain value objects at once so a
   bad value fails as an RFC 7807 problem and never reaches the use case, call
   `Execute`, encode the result.
3. Map errors in ONE table (`errors.Is` on domain sentinels) to the problem
   slugs of `apis/openapi.yaml` — `case-already-resolved` is the 409 of
   `ResolveException`; read `.claude/rules/rest-api.md` before adding a slug.
   `Idempotency-Key` is required on every mutating `POST`/`PUT` route
   (middleware before the handler; a replay returns the stored response).
4. Wire the use case in `cmd/` (the only place that wires layers).

Write at least one `httptest` per endpoint: a success path and the error paths
it can produce. No auth middleware.

## 4. Contract: update OpenAPI first or in the same change

Add the path to `apis/openapi.yaml` with request and response schemas, the
problem response for each error case (examples with
`https://errors.exception-management.warehouse-systems.dev/<slug>`), and an
`operationId`. Then add the route and use case to the table in
`.claude/rules/rest-api.md`. Lint the contract the way CI does:

```bash
spectral lint apis/openapi.yaml --ruleset .spectral.yaml --fail-severity=warn
```

## 5. Behaviour: add a godog scenario

If the endpoint is user-facing behaviour, add a `.feature` file under
`features/` (steps live next to it in `features/features_*_test.go`; `make bdd`
runs `TestFeatures`; never add a Go file at the repo root), Given/When/Then.
Scenarios drive the use cases over the in-memory adapters; the HTTP surface is
covered by the inbound HTTP adapter tests.

## 6. Verify before opening the PR

```bash
make check        # fmt-check vet build lint test
make check-all    # + coverage (90% gate) + arch-test + bdd
```

`make coverage` gates the domain and application packages at 90%; a new use
case with no test on its failure path is the most common way to miss it.
